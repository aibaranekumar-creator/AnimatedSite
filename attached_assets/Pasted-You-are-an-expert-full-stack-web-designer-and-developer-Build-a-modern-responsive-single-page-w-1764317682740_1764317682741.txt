You are an expert full-stack web designer and developer.

## Brand & Positioning

* SaaS product development
* DevOps
* Cloud Infrastructure (Azure, AWS, GCP)
* IT Infrastructure
* Website & web-application development

Tone: **professional, clean, bold, tech-focused**, but still simple for non-technical users.

## Design Requirements

* Dark theme color palette:

  * Primary accent: `ROY001` (use this as the brand highlight color)
  * Secondary: white for text and key elements
* Overall look: **modern dark SaaS landing page** with a slightly futuristic feel.
* Use strong contrast between sections with different dark shades.
* Rounded cards and soft but visible shadows suitable for dark mode.

### Animation Requirements (Very Important)

* The **home/hero section must be highly animated**:

  * A continuous animated background (e.g., moving gradient, floating particles, glowing geometric shapes, or subtle grid lines).
  * Smooth entrance animations for the main heading, subheading, buttons, and hero illustration (fade/slide/scale in).
* **Global hover effects**:

  * All buttons should have smooth hover transitions (scale, glow, border or background change).
  * Service cards and industry cards should slightly lift, glow, or scale on hover.
  * Navigation links should have a hover underline, glow, or subtle color transition.
* **Scroll / on-view animations**:

  * Each section (Services, Industries, How We Work, Tech Stack, Testimonials, Contact) should animate into view when scrolled to (e.g., fade-up, slide-in, or staggered card animations) using JavaScript + CSS classes or IntersectionObserver.
* **Micro-interactions**:

  * Add small animations on icons or badges when hovered.
  * Contact form inputs can have subtle focus/active states (glow/border effects).
* Animations must be **smooth and performance-friendly**, not overwhelming.
* Everything must remain fully responsive on all screen sizes.

## Tech Stack

* Use **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.
